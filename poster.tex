We compare five Python-based symbolic mathematics systems and libraries:
\textbf{Sage}, \textbf{Swiginac}, \textbf{SymPy}, \textbf{SymPyCore} and
\textbf{Pynac} (in order of first appearance). We would like to make those
programs more familiar to the reader and help him choose the right system
for his problem domain.

\headerbox{Why Python?}{name=why,column=1,span=2,row=0}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Python is a modern, general purpose programming language that is easy
to learn but has also very expressive syntax and semantics. It allows for
interoperability with foreign libraries, thanks to its C API and supporting
tools (e.g. Cython, f2py). Almost a complete scientific stack was created
around Python, with NumPy and SciPy leading the way. One missing piece of
this ecosystem was a system/library for symbolic mathematics. This gap was
filled with programs that were either developed from scratch entirely in
Python or use it as a command language (instead inventing yet another
mathematical DSL).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\bf Sage} is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It
combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.
\\
{\color{green} Pros:} full scientific stack, very functional, fast, large community
\\
{\color{red} Cons:} very large, not a library, complicated design
\\\\
{\bf Swiginac} is a Python interface to GiNaC, built with SWIG. The aim of Swiginac is
to make all the functionality of GiNaC accessible from Python as an extension module.
\\
{\color{green} Pros:} small library, fast
\\
{\color{red} Cons:} not actively developed, written in C++, no community
\\\\
{\bf SymPy} is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured
computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be
comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require
any external libraries.
\\
{\color{green} Pros:} small library, pure Python, very functional, extensible, large community
\\
{\color{red} Cons:} slow, needs better documentation
\\\\
{\bf SymPyCore} is inspired by many attempts to implement CAS for Python and it is created
to fix SymPy performance and robustness issues. SymPyCore does not yet have nearly as many
features as SymPy. Our goal is to work on in direction of merging the efforts with the SymPy
project in the future.
\\
{\color{green} Pros:} small library, fast, pure Python (with optional C extensions)
\\
{\color{red} Cons:} only basic functionality, weak documentation, no community
\\\\
{\bf Pynac} is a derivative of the C++ library GiNaC, which allows manipulation of symbolic
expressions. It currently provides the backend for symbolic expressions in Sage. The main
difference between Pynac and GiNaC is that Pynac relies on Sage to provide the operations
on numerical types, while GiNaC depends on CLN for this purpose.
\\
{\color{green} Pros:} small library, fast
\\
{\color{red} Cons:} only basic functionality, not a standalone library (depends on Sage)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Sage and SymPy may look very similar, but those are two very different
systems with completely different internal design, non-overlapping features
sets (e.g. Sage is very good at number theory and abstract algebra, but
SymPy has sophisticated pretty printing and code generation frameworks)
and quite different semantics:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{SymPy vs. SymPyCore}{name=sympysympycore,column=2,span=1,below=examples}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
SymPyCore is a fork of \texttt{sympy.core} module. The project was created
to quickly prototype a new fast symbolic core for SymPy. SymPyCore, however,
diverged from SymPy and it's unlikely it will be merged with it in soon.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Pynac vs. Swiginac}{name=pynacswiginac,column=2,span=1,below=sympysympycore}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Pynac and Swiginac both wrap GiNaC, a C++ library for symbolic computing. Pynac
uses Python's C API for this and Swiginac uses SWIG library. Both don't wrap the
entire library. Pynac requires Sage for coefficient arithmetics, so you can't use
it a standalone library, as opposed to Swiginac.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Conclusions}{name=conclusions,column=2,span=1,above=bottom}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Sage is the most stable and feature complete Python-based mathematics system,
so if you are looking for a ready to use solution that could replace Mathematica
or Maple, then Sage may be the optimal choice. However, Sage is a heavy weight
system with complex internals, so if a light weight, easily extensible and
embeddable library is needed, then SymPy may be a better choice. The other
three programs miss too many important features to be considered useful for
the end user.
